# What is Smart AQI Monitor?

Smart Air Quality Index Monitor (Smart AQI Monitor) is a wall mounted unit which measures:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Carbon Dioxide
- Carbon Monoxide
- Dust Particulate Level:
    - PM AE 1.0
    - PM AE 2.5
    - PM AE 10.0
- Light Intensity
- Volatile Organic Components:
    - Ozone
    - Methane

:spiral_notepad: _Note: This device is build for industrial application using EU accepted sensors._

Using these values, AQI can be calculated as follows:

$$
I_{p} = \frac{I_{Hi}-I_{Lo}}{BP_{Hi}-BP_{Lo}}(C_{P}-BP_{Lo}) + I_{Lo}
$$

where,\
$I_{p}$ = The Index of pollutant $p$ \
$C_{p}$ = The truncated concentration of pollutant $p$ \
$BP_{Hi}$ = The concentration breakpoint that is greater than or equal to $C_{p}$ \
$BP_{Lo}$ = The concentration breakpoint that is less than or equal to $C_{p}$ \
$I_{Hi}$ = The AQI Value corresponding to $BP_{Hi}$ \
$I_{Lo}$ = The AQI Value corresponding to $BP_{Lo}$

More Details on calculation AQI can be found [here](https://www.airnow.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/aqi-technical-assistance-document-sept2018.pdf).

# Features of AQI Monitor
- Approximately 6 hours of Battery Backup when supply is disconnected.
- Type C charging support.
- Interactive Touch Screen Display.
- Sensor and AQI Calculation accurate to 1 decimal place.

<!-- # How to assemble the project
1. Download the latest version of firmware from the /Firmware folder
2. Edit the Firmware as per the requirement with the help of guide provided in /Firmware/README.md
3. Order the components from the Bill of Materials as per the requirement.
4. Make the Hardware circuit using the guide in /Hardware/README.md
5.  Upload the firmware on the the hardware -->

:spiral_notepad: _Note: This project was written in Windows 11. You can port it to any Operating Software you wish to. Though the basics of installing dependencies might change a bit !!_

# Install Dependencies

## Install Arduino
Download and Install Arduino for Windows using this [link](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

## Install Visual Studio Code
Yes, I know. You can use any other IDE that you may like but I love VS Code. _So deal with it!!_

1. Download VS Code by clicking the [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install VS Code. Once the Installation is complete, launch it.
3. Click the Extensions tab and install the following extensions by clicking these links

   1. [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)
   2. [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)
   3. [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
   4. [VSC-Essentials](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gydunhn.vsc-essentials)
   5. [Prettier ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rvest.vs-code-prettier-eslint)

   _(Note: This Extensions are not neccesary but will surely make your life a bit easier when you are on the verge of unaliving yourself for picking up a project like this!!! Believe me... you are reading this ReadMe just due to their help!!)_ ðŸ‘¼

## Install PlatformIO IDE

The complete project was setup and written using PlatformIO for the ease of portability across devices and make task of setting up of new computers a bit easier. Install PIO with the [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide).

_This installation is gonna take a lot of time. When I mean lot, I mean a really lot lot. Make a coffee meanwhile?_  â˜•

# Editing the Project Files

## Download the Project Files

Open a new terminal and enter

```shell
git clone git@github.com:parth-20-07/Smart-AQI-Monitor.git
```

`cd` to the Project folder using 

```shell
cd Smart-AQI-Monitor/Firmware/Sensor\ Board/
```

Open the project folder in VS Code using

```shell
code .
```

In a New Terminal, Open the other firmware file using
```shell
cd Smart-AQI-Monitor/Firmware/Server\ Board/
```

Open the project folder in VS Code using

```shell
code .
```

Wait for probably a minute for PlatformIO to initialize completely.

## Upload Code to Board
- `Sensor Board` code to `nanoatmega328new`. Change the COM Port in `platformio.ini` to your system.
- `Server Board` code to `esp32doit-devkit-v1`. Change the COM Port in `platformio.ini` to your system.
